# SilverbirdWorkOrderAssigner
A work order algorithm that takes input as in a form of a table (.xlsx file) and assigns work based on worker certification, priority of tasks. It notifies the workers of their next job dynamically as when data is queried from a new file, it automatically sends a text message through the twilio api and stores the work assigned in a mongoDB so that its easily accessible in order to keep track of work assigned, completed etc. Using the twilio api, if you have the workers phone numbers, you can easily send them a text message concerning the work that they have to do next. mongoDB also makes it really useful to store data over the cloud so that you don't need a physical copy everytime you want to keep track of your workers. In fact, you only require a "physical" copy on your computer if you're inputting new data into the either the Work Order database or any of the other ones. This code lacks a frontend as it doesn't really have a need for one, as it would further lengthen the runtime of the code when adding data and since that everything that a company would store about their workers locations, credentials and certifications is stored over the cloud and notifications are sent immediately in the form of text messages.
